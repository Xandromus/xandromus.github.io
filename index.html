                    <p>I'm a web designer living in Austin, Texas. I have a passion for music, <a href="https://www.coffeekind.com/reading-room/the-three-waves-of-coffee/" target="_blank">third wave coffee</a>, and <a href="http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/cardigan-welsh-corgi/" target="_blank">Cardigan Welsh Corgis</a>. In addition to general frontend development, I specialize in UI and responsive design. I'm particularly interested in working with musicians and other creative individuals to bring their passions to life.</p>

                    <p>I play in a local progressive rock band called <a href="http://www.proudpeasant.com" target="_blank">Proud Peasant</a>. We released our debut album, Flight, to considerable acclaim in 2014, and it sold over 500 copies across the world. We released a vinyl 7" single entitled Cosmic Sound on noted UK label <a href="http://www.fruitsdemerrecords.com" target="_blank">Fruits de Mer Records</a> in 2016. We were reviewed in print magazines Classic Rock Magazine, Prog, and Shindig, and we had a track featured on BBC Radio. We're currently working on recording our second album, entitled Communion.</p>

                    <p>I spend the majority of my free time hanging out with my wife and stepson and our two pets: Walter the Cardigan Welsh Corgi and Oreo the cat. My stepson, Joseph, will be attending Cornell University next year, and I couldn't be prouder. Hobbies include watching old and/or arty movies, reading fantasy novels and a variety of comic books, and </p>
